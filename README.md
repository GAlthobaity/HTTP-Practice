# HTTP Practice
  *This project is part of the [INE](my.ine.com) x [SDA](https://t.co/zI6rJymObV) Data Science Program, [File Management & HTTP](https://my.ine.com/DataScience/courses/92e680b5/file-management-http).*

This project provides hands-on experience with basic HTTP concepts using the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) Python library. The project was intended to use [httpbin.org](httpbin.org), but due to its current **_Service Temporarily Unavailable_** status, [httpbin.io](httpbin.io) was used as an alternative. Additionally, the pytest version has been updated to 8.3.2.

## Features
- GET Requests.
- GET with Parameters.
- POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- Redirects.
